1. Group column,  shows groups' name which students are enroled. In the "All participants" export (without selection of group), you'll see a row for each student-group couple, it means that for the same student could have as many rows as groups he was affiliated.

Changes for Moodle 3.2
----------------------

This is a patched version of the plugin, based on the last known release. It used deprecated code (changed by MDL-46548, introduced in Moodle 2.8) but it works in Moodle 3.2.

If you want to test this code in other versions of Moodle (between 2.8 and 3.1), edit the file version.php, and change $plugin->requires  = 2016120500; with the right value of the Moodle version you need. The values are listed here https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Releases#Moodle_3.2

If you have success using this plugin in other Moodle versions, send an Issue in Github and I will update the minimum version :D
